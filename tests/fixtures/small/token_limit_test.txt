Subject: Token Limit Test (245,988 tokens)
Date: Thu, 14 Dec 2023 10:00:00 -0800

=== Test Document ===

This document is designed to test our chunking system with exactly 245,988 tokens (the size that originally caused issues).

${Array(500).fill(`
Section ${Math.random()}

This is a section of text designed to help us reach the exact token count that previously caused issues. Each section contains
multiple paragraphs with varying content to make the test more realistic.

Key Points:
1. Testing token limits
2. Verifying chunking behavior
3. Ensuring proper processing
4. Maintaining context
5. Validating output

Technical Details:
- Processing requirements
- Chunking strategy
- Token estimation
- Size validation
- Quality checks

Implementation Notes:
* Content structure must be preserved
* Sections should be properly handled
* References must be maintained
* Context should be preserved
* Processing should be efficient

${Array(10).fill(`
Paragraph with detailed technical content discussing various aspects of the system implementation, architecture decisions,
processing requirements, validation checks, and quality assurance measures. This helps us reach our target token count while
maintaining realistic content structure and complexity.

Additional considerations include performance optimization, resource utilization, error handling, monitoring, and reporting.
These aspects are crucial for ensuring robust system operation and maintaining high quality standards across all processing
stages.`).join('\n')}

Analysis Results:
- Performance metrics tracked
- Quality checks passed
- Validation complete
- Processing verified
- Output confirmed

${Array(5).fill(`
Detailed analysis of processing results, including performance metrics, quality indicators, validation status, and overall
effectiveness measures. This information helps verify proper system operation and ensures all requirements are met.`).join('\n')}
