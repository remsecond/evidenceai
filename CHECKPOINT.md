# PDF Processing Pipeline Checkpoint - January 9, 2025

## Latest Achievement: Base Document Structure

We've established a validated base document structure that serves as the foundation for all document processing:

### Core Data Structure
```json
{
  "thread_id": "string",
  "timeline": {
    "events": [{
      "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
      "type": "message|document|event",
      "content": "string",
      "participants": ["string"],
      "topics": ["string"],
      "sentiment": -1.0 to 1.0
    }]
  },
  "relationships": {
    "participant_network": {
      "participant1": {
        "participant2": "relationship_type"
      }
    },
    "topic_links": {
      "topic1": {
        "topic2": "relationship_type"
      }
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source_file": "string",
    "validation_status": "pending|valid|invalid",
    "processing_timestamp": "ISO-8601"
  }
}
```

### Validation Rules
1. Required Fields:
   - thread_id
   - timeline.events
   - relationships.participant_network
   - relationships.topic_links
   - All metadata fields

2. Data Types:
   - Timestamps must be valid ISO-8601 format
   - Event types must be one of: message, document, event
   - Sentiment scores must be between -1 and 1
   - Arrays (participants, topics) must contain strings

3. Relationship Structure:
   - Participant relationships are bidirectional
   - Topic relationships support hierarchical organization

### Base Processor Features
1. Document Creation:
   - Generates unique thread IDs
   - Initializes empty timeline and relationship structures
   - Sets initial metadata with pending status

2. Event Management:
   - Adds timeline events with automatic timestamps
   - Validates event structure and content
   - Maintains chronological order

3. Relationship Mapping:
   - Tracks participant interactions
   - Maps topic relationships
   - Supports relationship type classification

4. Validation:
   - Schema validation using Ajv
   - Format validation for dates and enums
   - Error reporting with detailed messages

## Previously Working Features

1. PDF Processing Pipeline
- Handles large PDFs (tested up to 1,048 pages, ~515K tokens)
- Smart chunking with configurable size limits (currently 25K tokens)
- Preserves document structure and section boundaries
- Maintains metadata and context

2. Output Organization
- Structured output in ai-outputs/[model]/
- Separate directories for each model (claude, deepseek, gpt4, notebooklm, sonnet)
- Timestamped processing runs
- Complete extraction with metadata

3. File Outputs
- Chunked JSON files with metadata
- Full extracted text
- Processing reports
- Success logs

## Tested Files
1. OFW_Messages_Report_Dec.pdf
   - 358 pages
   - ~180K tokens
   - 14 balanced chunks

2. Emails w_ Jennifer after Sept 1.pdf
   - 125 pages
   - ~82K tokens
   - 6 balanced chunks

3. All OFW Messages.pdf
   - 1,048 pages
   - ~515K tokens
   - 40 balanced chunks

## Key Components
1. src/schemas/base-schema.js
   - Core data structure definition
   - Validation rules and constraints
   - Schema versioning

2. src/services/base-processor.js
   - Base document processing logic
   - Event and relationship management
   - Validation handling

3. scripts/process-ofw-with-pdf.js
   - Main pipeline script
   - Handles PDF processing
   - Creates model-specific output directories
   - Generates structured output files

4. src/services/pdf-processor.js
   - Core PDF processing logic
   - Smart chunking algorithm
   - Structure preservation
   - Metadata extraction

## Usage
```bash
# Process a PDF file
node scripts/process-ofw-with-pdf.js "path/to/your.pdf"

# Run base processor tests
node test-base-processor.js
```

## Latest Improvements

1. Enhanced Name Detection:
- Comprehensive filters for titles, roles, and honorifics
- Filters for product/service names and descriptions
- Filters for organization names and types
- Filters for location/building names
- Filters for compound phrases and time references

2. Processing Capabilities:
- Handles 265-page documents in ~2.0 seconds
- Processes 96,315 words into 2,718 timeline events
- Extracts 276 participant relationships (reduced from 306)
- Maps 71 topic relationships

3. Name Filtering Categories:
- System/Header Terms:
  * Date, Subject, Message, System, Account, etc.
- Time/Date References:
  * Days, months, relative dates
- Generic Greetings/Phrases:
  * Good Morning, Hi There, Thank You, etc.
- Titles and Roles:
  * Dr, Mr, Mrs, Director, President, etc.
- Product/Service Names:
  * Equipment, Services, Solutions, etc.
- Organization Names:
  * Inc, LLC, Foundation, Association, etc.
- Location/Building Names:
  * Ave, St, Plaza, Park, Mall, etc.

4. Relationship Analysis:
- Improved context detection:
