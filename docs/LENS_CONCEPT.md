# Lens: Email Discovery Reimagined

## Core Concept

### 1. The Problem
```javascript
const emailChallenges = {
  search: {
    limitations: [
      "Basic keyword matching",
      "No context understanding",
      "Missing relationship mapping"
    ],
    frustrations: [
      "Hard to find old emails",
      "Lost attachments",
      "Missing connections"
    ],
    impact: [
      "Wasted time",
      "Lost information",
      "Reduced productivity"
    ]
  }
};
```

### 2. Our Solution
```javascript
const lensCapabilities = {
  extraction: {
    content: "Full email content and attachments",
    metadata: "Headers, dates, participants",
    attachments: "Document content and context"
  },
  processing: {
    analysis: "Deep content understanding",
    relationships: "Connection mapping",
    context: "Conversation threading"
  },

    content: [
      "#topic/[subject]",
      "#type/[category]",
      "#priority/[level]"
    ],
    metadata: [
      "#date/[yyyy-mm-dd]",
      "#thread/[id]",
      "#status/[state]"
    ]
  },
  relationships: {
    conversations: [
      "#thread/[topic]",
      "#relates_to/[email]",
      "#continues/[thread]"
    ],
    documents: [
      "#attachment/[type]",
      "#version/[number]",
      "#references/[doc]"
    ],
    context: [
      "#project/[name]",
      "#client/[organization]",
      "#action/[type]"
