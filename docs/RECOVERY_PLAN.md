# Recovery Plan - January 9, 2024

## Current Working Components

1. PDF Processing Pipeline ✓
   - Main Script: process-ofw-with-pdf.js
   - Core Service: pdf-processor.js
   - LLM Integration: deepseek-processor.js
   - Features:
     - Smart chunking ✓
     - Metadata extraction ✓
     - Multiple output formats ✓

2. Google Integration ✓
   - Main Service: google-sheets.js
   - Test Script: test-sheets-integration.js
   - Features:
     - Document tracking ✓
     - Status updates ✓
     - Category management ✓

## Recovery Steps

1. Verify Core Pipeline ✓
   ```bash
   node scripts/process-ofw-with-pdf.js test-data/OFW_Messages_Report_Dec.pdf
   ```
   - Should process PDF ✓
   - Generate structured output ✓
   - Create organized chunks ✓

2. Test Google Integration ✓
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-sheets-integration.js
   ```
   - Should connect to Google Sheets ✓
   - Create tracking structure ✓
   - Add test document ✓

3. Run End-to-End Test ✓
   - Process PDF file ✓
   - Track in Google Sheets ✓
   - Verify all outputs ✓

## Verification Checklist

1. PDF Processing ✓
   - [x] Text extraction working
   - [x] Proper chunking
   - [x] Metadata generation
   - [x] Output organization

2. Google Integration ✓
   - [x] Authentication working
   - [x] Sheet creation successful
   - [x] Document tracking functional
   - [x] Status updates working

3. System Health ✓
   - [x] No memory issues
   - [x] Clean error handling
   - [x] Proper logging
   - [x] Output validation

## Current Status
We have successfully recovered the working state:
- PDF processing pipeline is operational
- Google Sheets integration is working
- Test document has been processed and tracked
- New spreadsheet created: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18vpRQjjfDE65VoShiyMuq9PGE6C6sKyQ916sVRWAI7M

## Stable Branch
The working state has been preserved in the `core-pipeline-stable` branch. This branch contains:
- Complete PDF processing pipeline
- Google Sheets integration
- Clean, focused codebase
- Full documentation

## Next Steps

1. Mission Control Integration
   - Integrate PDF pipeline into Mission Control
   - Add Google Sheets tracking to UI
   - Keep interface simple and focused
   - Test end-to-end workflow

2. Future Development
   - Keep experimental features in separate branches
   - Use core-pipeline-stable as base for stable features
   - Document all changes thoroughly
   - Maintain working configuration

## Important Notes

- DO NOT add complexity until core is stable
- Keep experimental features in separate branches
- Document all testing results
- Maintain working configuration
- Always branch from core-pipeline-stable for new stable features
