This pipeline transforms our document processing capabilities into a powerful tagging system by:

1. Extracting Rich Data:
   - Document metadata
   - Entity information
   - Relationships and context

2. Generating Smart Tags:
   - Multiple categories
   - Relationship mapping
   - AI-enhanced insights

3. Enabling Discovery:
   - Quick document finding
   - Relationship exploration
   - Pattern recognition

4. Creating Value:
   - Automated organization
   - Knowledge capture
   - Workflow optimization

The system leverages our existing pipeline's strengths while adding powerful tagging capabilities that make information more discoverable and valuable.
