# Cline Context System

This directory maintains Cline's awareness of:
- Development protocol and rules
- Latest working demo
- Session history and progress
- Project checkpoints

When starting a new task, Cline will:
1. Load this context
2. Review the latest demo
3. Understand current project state
4. Apply development protocols

This ensures consistent context across sessions.
