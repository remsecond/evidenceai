  "protocol": "# Development Protocol\r\n\r\n## Session Start Checklist\r\n1. Review last working demo video/proof\r\n2. State what specific feature will be built this session\r\n3. Confirm we can process one real file or show one working page\r\n4. Verify current main branch is in working state\r\n\r\n## Core Rules\r\n\r\n### 1. The \"Run It Now\" Rule\r\n- [ ] Every session MUST end with a runnable demo\r\n- [ ] All new code MUST be tested with real data\r\n- [ ] No \"we'll fix it later\" exceptions\r\n- [ ] If it doesn't run, we don't move forward\r\n\r\n### 2. The \"One File\" Test\r\n- [ ] Process one real file end-to-end before any new features\r\n- [ ] Show actual output, not just logs\r\n- [ ] No architecture discussions until basic processing works\r\n- [ ] Document the test file and results\r\n\r\n### 3. Concrete Proof Requirements\r\nFor any feature:\r\n- [ ] Website: Must show in browser\r\n- [ ] Processing: Must handle real document\r\n- [ ] API: Must show actual request/response\r\n- [ ] No theoretical \"it will work when...\" promises\r\n\r\n### 4. Three-Strike System\r\nStop and revert if we catch:\r\n1. Writing untested code\r\n2. Planning before basics work\r\n3. Adding complexity to non-working components\r\n\r\n### 5. Daily Working Demo\r\n- [ ] Record demo video of working features\r\n- [ ] Save demo files and outputs\r\n- [ ] Document what works and what doesn't\r\n- [ ] No exceptions - if we can't demo it, it doesn't exist\r\n\r\n## Session Protocol\r\n\r\n### Start of Session\r\n1. Dev Manager Status Check:\r\n   - [ ] Review this protocol\r\n   - [ ] Verify last working demo\r\n   - [ ] State today's specific goal\r\n   - [ ] Confirm we have test files ready\r\n\r\n2. Feature Implementation:\r\n   - [ ] Start with smallest working piece\r\n   - [ ] Test with real data\r\n   - [ ] Show working output\r\n   - [ ] Only then consider improvements\r\n\r\n3. End of Session:\r\n   - [ ] Demo working features\r\n   - [ ] Record proof of functionality\r\n   - [ ] Document what was completed\r\n   - [ ] Save all test files and outputs\r\n\r\n## Enforcement\r\n\r\nIf any rule is violated:\r\n1. Immediately stop development\r\n2. Revert to last working state\r\n3. Rebuild from there with simpler approach\r\n\r\n## Session Documentation Template\r\n\r\n```\r\nDate: [DATE]\r\nLast Working Demo: [LINK/PATH]\r\nToday's Goal: [SPECIFIC FEATURE]\r\n\r\nStarting State:\r\n- What works now: [LIST]\r\n- Test files ready: [YES/NO]\r\n- Current limitations: [LIST]\r\n\r\nEnd of Session:\r\n- Working features: [LIST]\r\n- Demo recording: [LINK/PATH]\r\n- Test files: [PATHS]\r\n- Known issues: [LIST]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Remember\r\n\r\n1. Working code > Perfect code\r\n2. Real output > Planned features\r\n3. Simple + Working > Complex + Broken\r\n4. Today's demo > Tomorrow's promise\r\n\r\nStart every session by reviewing this protocol. No exceptions.\r\n",
